# OnexOS

The OnexOS Android app gives you and your family a 3D creative space where you can
all sketch 3D objects and places and write and post 2D notes and documents around in
virtual rooms.

Use it as a thinking space, a creative space or a sharing space; have fun exploring each
others creations.

You can run it on a shared family Android tablet, or on the LineageOS version of Android
on a Raspberry Pi 4 behind your family TV! Each family member can have their own stuff.

### What can you do?

This space owes its creative "mashability" to being sewn, tied or snapped together
everywhere by "links" - links between my scrapbook of notes and photos and one of your
notes, or between your leaves and my tree, or between my forest and your city.

You build everything in OnexOS from simple coloured panels that can have text or images
on them. These are then linked together into the creative space that you play in. With
just these basic starting materials you can:

 - Build a house from panels linked into rooms and rooms linked together
 - Then build a street made of links to all the houses of your family
 - Then build a city with links to the streets
 - Leave messages around linked to the walls of the family virtual home kitchen
 - Then collect those onto a pinboard by grabbing and pasting their links
 - Start up a discussion board, which has lists of links to messages and family members
 - Put down a library on the high street full of links to documents you have each created
 - Or even holiday plans, favourite recipes or music reviews
 - Sit in the library surrounded by links to snippets of text and images while you compose a story
 - Next to the library, place a gallery with walls linking to everyone's favourite photos
 - Rebuild the gallery to create many rooms organised by theme
 - Create a billboard with links to text paragraphs and images, describing an upcoming event you'll all attend
 - Remind everyone by putting the billboard up along the street, by simply dropping its link down
 - Create signs pointing the way to landmarks, containing a link to allow direct teleporting
 - Create a warehouse store full of links to 3D objects to share with each other
 - Fill it with plants, tables, trees, rocks, houses, castles
 - You can create a pretty tree on a little hill
 - Then multiply that up to a forest on a mountain by dropping hill and tree links all over
 - Attach that mountain to the back of your city with just a link, and another link to get back again
 - If a family member makes a fantasy village, they can share its link with the family on the discussion board
 - Then you can pin the village to the top of the mountain with its link and a link back
