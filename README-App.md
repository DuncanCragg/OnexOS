_This is a description of what I'm working on now, not what the app does yet!_

# LinkCraft

LinkCraft is an Android app that gives you and your family a 3D creative space where you
can all build 3D objects and places and write and post 2D notes and documents around in
virtual rooms.

### What's it for?

You can use LinkCraft as a family creative space, a thinking space or a sharing space;
have fun exploring each other's creations, working together and sharing 3D and 2D
objects.

### What's it like to use?

You build everything in LinkCraft from simple coloured panels - echoing the simplicity
and power of Minecraft's blocks. Both 3D room walls and furniture and 2D messages and
documents are built from these flat panels.

You can add text or photos to any panel, to make a message, a post or a sign. Unlike in
Minecraft, text on our panels uses proper rounded fonts, not blocky ones!

### What's novel about it?

This space really owes its creative "mashability" to the way all your family's panels
are sewn, pinned, tied and snapped together everywhere by "links".

These links work somewhat like the Web's URLs in that they form a handle or hook onto
everything in the world. This allows you to point at, pick up, share and reuse anything
and everything that you see there.

### What can you do with links?

The first thing you may do in LinkCraft is to build a family room to share stuff. Just
quickly snap or link together some panels into a room, then put a panel on the wall as a
pinboard space to pin or link to messages and photos. Everyone can visit this room and
will see each other and can say "Hi!", and add to the pinboard.

You can add more rooms to your virtual family home, perhaps one each, for your own notes
and photos, pinned to the walls or even left lying around on the floor. Now:

 - if anyone wants to share something from their room, they simply grab its link and pin
   it to the kitchen pinboard
 - now if they change the text of something they shared from within their virtual
   bedroom, everyone in the kitchen can see that change too
 - drop in a link from your scrapbook of notes and photos to one of your mum's notes on
   the desk in her virtual study
 - pin a link in the middle of your virtual kitchen wall to one of your scrapbook photos
 - keep a shopping list in the virtual kitchen that everyone can see when going out

### How does the 2D stuff work in 3D?

There are panels representing documents, that know about layout. You can drop panels
with text onto or into them and they will then line up with one another and you can
scroll them. You can then re-order this sequence of paragraph panels easily.

Similarly, there's a chat panel, where the stack of message panels it contains can't be
re-ordered as they are timestamped, so can only be added to at the end.

These document and chat panels are really just sequences of links to paragraph panels.
So this means that you can easily build a new document or poster by simply collecting
and dropping some links into it. These could be links to paragraph or message panels
that you find elsewhere, links to select chat messages or links to photos you like on
someone's wall. You can of course, link to bigger things in your document, like other
documents, or to complete 3D objects, or to an entire virtual city.

With document, poster and chat panels:

 - before going out, anyone can quickly make a personal shopping list by grabbing just the
   links to the items of the shared one that they plan to fetch themselves
 - create a 2D chat panel on the kitchen wall, which everyone can grab a link to to put
   in their own rooms
 - create a billboard with links to text paragraphs and images, describing an upcoming
   event you'll all attend
 - remind everyone by putting the billboard up along the street, by simply dropping its
   link down
 - if the event time changes, when you edit the billboard, all instances around update
 - create signs pointing the way to landmarks, containing a link to allow direct teleporting

### How do you use links instead of blocks to build worlds?

Having everything in the world linked together like this allows you to quickly create a
potentially huge shared world to play in.

With links you can build a city:

 - build a house from panels linked into rooms and rooms linked together
 - then build a street made of links to all the houses of your family
 - add some extra houses by creating one house and dropping its link up the street
 - then build a city with links to the streets

You can build shared experiences like a library:

 - put down a library on the high street full of links collecting the best documents you
   have each created
 - maybe the holiday plans, favourite recipes or music reviews you each have in your rooms
 - collect an array of some links to snippets of text and images that you find useful for
   a short story you're writing
 - obviously, a stack, array or list of links is also an object in the world, so has its
   own link
 - if you like a paragraph in someone's document, then of course it also has a link that
   you can grab for your snippet collection
 - sit in the library and surround yourself with (links to) those snippets while you
   compose it

Or a gallery:

 - next to the library, place a gallery with walls linking to everyone's favourite
   photos in their albums or photo frames
 - rebuild the gallery to create many rooms organised by theme
 - a picture matching two themes in the gallery can appear twice with a link from each room
 - if you like the gallery's "landscape" room, simply grab its link and paste it onto
   your own virtual house
 - now you can wander in easily at any time (but you'll be in the gallery now, so need
   to hit the back button to return home!)

Or a warehouse:

 - create a warehouse store full of links to 3D objects to share with each other
 - fill it with plants, tables, trees, rocks, houses, castles
 - if you want to use something, you don't walk out with it, you just grab a link to it
   and drop it where you want
 - you can even grab a bit of that castle: if you like its tallest tower, simply take
   its link

You can build entire worlds:

 - create a pretty tree on a little hill
 - replicate a link from your tree to your sister's leaf, repeated all over it
 - then multiply that tree up to a forest on a mountain by dropping hill and tree links
   all over
 - if your sister changes the leaf to red in autumn, all trees that use the leaf go red
   together
 - attach that mountain to the back of your city with just a link, and another link to
   get back again
 - but have a signpost in the forest that also contains the city's link so you can save
   the walk and teleport there!
 - if a family member makes a fantasy village, they can share its link with the family
   in the chat room
 - then you can pin the village to the top of the mountain with its link and a link back

Even our avatars have a link. So if you meet someone, grab the link to their avatar. Now
whenever you want to see where they are, just view that link! And you're only truly "in"
a place if it links to your avatar, so you can visit somewhere invisibly if you want.

### Nice! Anything else?

Panels can be coloured "transparent", but still show their attached image, so this
way you can create objects that are flat, yet have a shape that isn't rectangular, as
long as the image also has a transparent background. This allows you to create leaves
and flowers, for example. To create a flower, you can cross two images at right angles
(as Minecraft does).

### What's the nearest "competitor"?

Since there's nothing really like LinkCraft, it's hard to say! It can perhaps be described
as:

_Like Minecraft Creative but instead of stacking blocks it has links between panels._

LinkCraft thus retains Minecraft's simplicity and power in doing everything the same basic way.

The top benefit of that is that, unlike in Minecraft, you can just pick up your house by
its link and move it, clone it, or share it!

### Who's it for?

It's aimed at families. Mums, dads, grannies, girls, boys. Cross-demographic!

### What will it run on?

It's an Android app so you can run it on a shared family tablet, or on your own phones.
It works over the home WiFi between everyone's Android device.

### Where's all our stuff kept?

Again, unlike Minecraft:

 - Each family member has their own stuff on their own device, and all that is sewn
   together into the shared family world - rather than everyone joining someone else's
   world that's just on their device
 - There's only one shared family world, that's always available; you don't need to keep
   restarting in new worlds and waiting for them to load; LinkCraft is designed to be
   running all the time so you can just drop in at any time
 - So links work across devices, too, and everything is shared securely just over the
   domestic WiFi
 - Hence you can all keep working on your own creations away from home and then re-sync
   when you return
 - There's no account set-up or logging in: you can all just jump in and get started
   immediately!

### What's the business model?

There is none. Free and Open software. No adverts.
