# OnexOS

OnexOS gives you and your family a 3D creative space where you can all build 3D objects
and places and write and post 2D notes and documents around in virtual rooms.

### What's it for?

You can use OnexOS as a thinking space, a family creative space or a sharing space; have
fun exploring each other's creations, working together and sharing 2D and 3D objects.

### Who's it for?

It's aimed at families. Mums, dads, grannies, girls, boys. Cross-demographic.

### What will it run on?

It's an Android app so you can run it on a shared family tablet, or on a version of
Android (LineageOS) on a Raspberry Pi 4 behind your family TV! It works over the home
WiFi between everyone's Android device.

### What's novel about it?

You build everything in OnexOS from simple coloured panels - echoing the simplicity and
power of Minecraft's blocks.

This space really owes its creative "mashability" to the way all your family's panels
are sewn, pinned, tied and snapped together everywhere by "links", forming a potentially
huge shared world to play in. Links work somewhat like the Web's URLs in that they form
a handle or hook onto anything and everything you see in the world.

### Nice! Anything else?

You can add text or images to any panel. Unlike in Minecraft, text on our panels uses
proper rounded fonts and you can paste your photos on them!

In addition, there are panels that know about layout, so you can drop paragraph panels
onto or into them, and they're rendered lined up. You can then re-order the paragraph
panels easily. Similarly, there's a chat panel, where the list of message panels it
contains can only be added to at the end. Such panels have scrollers, too.

### What can you do with links?

The document and chat panels mentioned above are really just lists of links to paragraph
panels. So this means that, for example, you can build a new document from links to a
few select chat message panels.

You can put in a link between:

 - your scrapbook of notes and photos and one of your mum's notes on the desk in her
   virtual study
 - the virtual kitchen wall and one of your scrapbook photos
 - your tree and your sister's leaf, repeated all over it
    - if she changes the leaf to red in autumn, all trees that use the leaf go red together
 - your grandad's forest and your city, so you can just walk across and back
    - but have a signpost in the forest that also contains the city's link so you can
      save the walk and teleport there!

With links you can:

 - Build a house from panels linked into rooms and rooms linked together
 - Then build a street made of links to all the houses of your family
 - Add some extra houses by creating one house and dropping its link up the street
 - Then build a city with links to the streets
 - Leave messages around linked (pinned) to the walls of the family virtual home
 - Then collect all of those onto a kitchen pinboard by grabbing and pasting all of
   their links
 - Now if someone changes a message in their virtual bedroom, someone in the kitchen
   sees that
 - Create a 2D chat room, which has lists of links to messages and to family members
 - But then meet in a 3D room to chat as well; a room links to the people present
 - Put down a library on the high street full of links collecting the best documents you
   have each created
 - Maybe the holiday plans, favourite recipes or music reviews you each have in your rooms
 - Collect a list of some links to snippets of text and images that you find useful for
   a short story you're writing
 - Obviously, lists are objects too, and also have links
 - If you like a paragraph in someone's document, then of course it also has a link that
   you can grab for your snippet list
 - Sit in the library and surround yourself with (links to) those snippets while you
   compose it
 - Next to the library, place a gallery with walls linking to everyone's favourite
   photos in their albums or photo frames
 - Rebuild the gallery to create many rooms organised by theme; a picture matching two
   themes can appear twice
 - If you like the gallery's "landscape" room, simply grab its link and paste it into
   your own virtual house where you can wander in easily
 - Create a billboard with links to text paragraphs and images, describing an upcoming
   event you'll all attend
 - Remind everyone by putting the billboard up along the street, by simply dropping its
   link down
 - If the event time changes, when you edit the billboard, all instances around update
 - Create signs pointing the way to landmarks, containing a link to allow direct teleporting
 - Create a warehouse store full of links to 3D objects to share with each other
 - Fill it with plants, tables, trees, rocks, houses, castles
 - If you want to use something, you don't walk out with it, you just grab a link to it
   and drop it where you want
 - You can even grab a bit of that castle: if you like its tallest tower, simply take
   its link
 - Create a pretty tree on a little hill
 - Then multiply that up to a forest on a mountain by dropping hill and tree links all over
 - Attach that mountain to the back of your city with just a link, and another link to
   get back again
 - If a family member makes a fantasy village, they can share its link with the family
   in the chat room
 - Then you can pin the village to the top of the mountain with its link and a link back

Even your avatar has a link. So if you meet someone, grab their link and now whenever you
want to see where they are, just view that link! And you're only truly "in" a place if
it links to your avatar, so you can visit somewhere invisibly if you want.

### What's the nearest "competitor"?

Since there's nothing really like OnexOS, it's hard to say! It can perhaps be described
as:

_Like Minecraft Creative - with the simplicity and power of doing everything the same
basic way - but replacing stacking blocks with links between panels._

The top benefit of that is that you can just pick up your house by its link and move it,
or clone it!

### Where's all our stuff kept?

Again, unlike Minecraft:

 - Each family member has their own stuff on their own device, and all that is sewn
   together into the shared family world - rather than everyone joining someone else's
   world that's just on their device
 - There's only one shared family world, that's always available; you don't need to keep
   restarting in new worlds and waiting for them to load; OnexOS is designed to be
   running all the time so you can just drop in at any time
 - So links work across devices, too, and everything is shared securely just over the
   domestic WiFi
 - Hence you can all keep working on your own creations away from home and then re-sync
   when you return
 - There's no account set-up or logging in: you can all just jump in and get started
   immediately!

### What's the business model?

There is none. Free and Open software. No adverts.
