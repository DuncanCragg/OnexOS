# OnexOS

OnexOS gives you and your family a 3D creative space where you can all build 3D objects
and places and write and post 2D notes and documents around in virtual rooms.

### What's it for?

You can use OnexOS as a thinking space, a family creative space or a sharing space; have
fun exploring each other's creations, working together and sharing 2D and 3D objects.

### Who's it for?

It's aimed at families. Mums, dads, grannies, girls, boys. Cross-demographic.

### What will it run on?

It's an Android app so you can run it on a shared family tablet, or on a version of
Android (LineageOS) on a Raspberry Pi 4 behind your family TV! It works over the home
WiFi between everyone's Android device.

### What's novel about it?

You build everything in OnexOS from simple coloured panels that can have text or images
on them - echoing the simplicity and power of Minecraft's blocks.

But this space really owes its creative "mashability" to the way all your family's
panels are sewn, pinned, tied and snapped together everywhere by "links", forming a
potentially huge shared playground. Links work somewhat like the Web's URLs in that they
form a handle or hook onto anything you see in the world.

### What can you do with links?

You can put in links between your scrapbook of notes and photos and one of your mum's
notes, between the virtual kitchen wall and one of those photos, between your leaves and
your sister's tree, or between your grandad's forest and your city.

### Can you give some more examples?

with just these basic starting materials you can:

 - Build a house from panels linked into rooms and rooms linked together
 - Then build a street made of links to all the houses of your family
 - Then build a city with links to the streets
 - Leave messages around linked to the walls of the family virtual home kitchen
 - Then collect those onto a pinboard by grabbing and pasting their links
 - Create a 2D chat room, which has lists of links to messages and to family members
 - But then meet in a 3D room to chat as well; a room links to the people present
 - Put down a library on the high street full of links to documents you have each created
 - Or even holiday plans, favourite recipes or music reviews
 - Sit in the library surrounded by links to snippets of text and images while you
   compose a story
 - Next to the library, place a gallery with walls linking to everyone's favourite photos
 - Rebuild the gallery to create many rooms organised by theme
 - Create a billboard with links to text paragraphs and images, describing an upcoming
   event you'll all attend
 - Remind everyone by putting the billboard up along the street, by simply dropping its
   link down
 - Create signs pointing the way to landmarks, containing a link to allow direct teleporting
 - Create a warehouse store full of links to 3D objects to share with each other
 - Fill it with plants, tables, trees, rocks, houses, castles
 - You can create a pretty tree on a little hill
 - Then multiply that up to a forest on a mountain by dropping hill and tree links all over
 - Attach that mountain to the back of your city with just a link, and another link to
   get back again
 - If a family member makes a fantasy village, they can share its link with the family
   in the chat room
 - Then you can pin the village to the top of the mountain with its link and a link back

### What's the nearest "competitor"?

Since there's nothing really like OnexOS, it's hard to say! It can perhaps be described
as:

_Like Minecraft Creative - with the simplicity and power of doing everything the same
basic way - but replacing stacking blocks with links between panels._

The top benefit of that is that you can just pick up your house by its link and move or
copy it!

Further, unlike Minecraft:

 - there's only one shared family world, that's always available; you don't need to keep
   restarting in new worlds and waiting for them to load; OnexOS is designed to be
   running all the time so you can just drop in at any time
 - there's no account set-up or logging in: you can all just jump in and get started
   immediately!
 - each family member can have their own stuff on their own device rather than joining
   someone else's world - links work across devices, too, and everything is shared
   securely just over the domestic WiFi; but you can all keep working on your own
   creations away from home and re-sync when you return.

Oh, and:

 - our panels can have proper rounded text and your photos on them!

### What's the business model?

There is none. Free and Open software. No adverts.
