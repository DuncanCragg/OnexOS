# LinkCraft

LinkCraft is an Android app creating a virtual world, an open 3D universe.

It's something like a mix between Minecraft Creative, Avakin Life and Second Life, so
aimed at whole families, not just kids _or_ teens _or_ adults.

### What can you do?

All the usual Virtual World things: meet, chat, share, build, co-create, work, play.

### What's novel about it?

Everyone running LinkCraft owns their own chunks of the world that we're all building
together. You host and serve your own stuff on your own phone or tablet.

We then all sew our virtual objects and places together - into a single, vast, seamless
universe, owned by all of us.

This is enabled by LinkCraft's **links**.

LinkCraft links work somewhat like the Web's URLs in that they form handles or hooks
onto things in the world, where-ever they may be.

So we can have direct links to objects inside each other's phones or tablets.

### How do links actually manifest in this world?

Every single object you create or see in the shared world has a link - cities, streets,
houses, rooms, tables, vases, flowers and petals.

Everything is sewn, pinned, tied and snapped together using these links.

Everything can be pointed to, picked up, reused, shared and saved via their links.

I can link to a city you've built from my virtual garden, which lets me see it and just
walk across into it, or you can link to a leaf I made, and use it yourself.

### How do I control who can see and change my stuff?

Everything you build stays owned by you, on your own device. You get to decide who can
see or who can change your stuff: your objects can be set up to be seen only by your
family or by the public.

You can set up a family photo wall, or a message board or to-do list in a virtual family
room, that are all shared just over the family WiFi.

There's no account set-up, and no adverts (unless someone creates a billboard
somewhere!). You can all just jump in and start co-creating!

### Is this something like a Metaverse?

Yes, you can describe it as a Metaverse. Being open, there's no lock-in to a "walled
garden", so it's a bit like the World Wide Web in that regard.

### So why not base this on the good ole' Web? That's got links already!

There are three reasons why we are better off starting again, since we basically have to
start again anyway if we use the Web:

##### Fine-grained links; transclusion

The Web's links are to bundles of entire pages that give a hefty reload - you can't just
link to a paragraph! You can link to an image inside a page, but that's about it.

LinkCraft's links are to each little object in a scene, as well as to entire worlds.

##### Liveness and Presence

Objects in the world (including you!) need to be live, animated. The Web doesn't do
updates natively, so it needs add-on, ad-hoc, incompatible technologies to deliver updates.

LinkCraft has a simple open protocol to both fetch objects and to send their updates
between devices.

##### Peer-to-peer

The Web has servers which are tricky to set up and run, so are usually run by techies.
Your own data and identity are hidden away somewhere between these servers and the
browser.

LinkCraft gives you back control over your own data and your own identity because it's all
hosted on your own devices.

Notes:

 - you can still use the Web's URLs to pull content into the LinkCraft universe
 - you can still use trusted online servers to give you backups and more reliable
   serving of your data, if you get serious! But these are generic services allowing you
   to easily switch providers
 - the main "cost" of not running inside the Web's browsers is needing to download
   LinkCraft, but people install apps all the time, so that's not a huge blocker

### What's the business model?

There is none. Free and Open software and protocols. No adverts.
