_This is a description of what I'm working on now, not what the app does yet!_

# LinkCraft

LinkCraft is an Android app creating a virtual world, an open 3D universe.

It's something like a mix between Minecraft Creative, Avakin Life and Second Life, so
aimed at whole families, not just kids _or_ teens _or_ adults.

### What can you do?

All the usual Virtual World things: meet, chat, share, build, co-create, work, play.

### What's novel about it?

Everyone running LinkCraft owns their own chunks of the world that we're all building
together. You host and serve your own stuff on your own phone or tablet.

We then all sew our virtual objects and places together - into a single, vast, seamless
universe, owned by all of us.

This is enabled by LinkCraft's **links**.

LinkCraft links work somewhat like the Web's URLs in that they form handles or hooks
onto things in the world, where-ever they may be.

So we can have direct links to objects inside each other's phones or tablets.

### How do links actually manifest in this world?

Every single object you create or see in the shared world has a link - cities, streets,
houses, rooms, tables, vases, flowers and petals.

Everything is sewn, pinned, tied and snapped together using these links.

Everything can be pointed to, picked up, reused, shared and saved via their links.

I can link to a city you've built from my virtual garden, which lets me see it and just
walk across into it, or you can link to a leaf I made, and use it yourself.

### How do I control who can see and change my stuff?

Everything you build stays owned by you, on your own device. You get to decide who can
see or who can change your stuff: your objects can be set up to be seen only by your
family or by the public.

You can set up a family photo wall, or a message board or to-do list in a virtual family
room, that are all shared just over the family WiFi.

### What's the business model?

There is none. Free and open software and protocols.

There's no account set-up, and no adverts (unless someone creates a billboard
somewhere!). You can all just jump in and start co-creating!

### Is this something like a Metaverse?

Yes, you can describe it as a Metaverse. But without VR (at first - maybe AR will overtake
VR anyway) and no Blockchains in sight! Being open, there's no lock-in to a "walled
garden", so it's a bit like the World Wide Web in that regard.

### So why not base this on the good ole' Web? That's got links already!
