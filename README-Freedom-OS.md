An OS _with no apps_ - returning to normal people the power and freedom promised by their own technology!

See http://object.network/ and https://duncancragg.substack.com/

TL;DR: replaces apps and services with shared spaces containing us and our stuff that we can all "pin" together, hosted on our own devices.

### The app trap

Facebook and Google want your digital stuff, so they create traps to capture it, and you.

Apps also trap and fragment your digital stuff so nothing works together seamlessly.

And don't dare to ask for functionality that _you_ want, instead of meekly accepting whatever marketing-driven trap-crap they throw at you with the latest update.

### An OS without apps

OnexOS is an OS without apps, hence no more app traps.

### OnexOSes create shared spaces

Our social network and media posts created in OnexOS now live in spaces that we can share.

### It's a Metaverse, or a cyberspace

When you open your device running OnexOS, you enter spaces containing all your stuff, and everyone else's.

### Everything just pins together

We can "pin" together the spaces and things we own and build into super-spaces, spanning the globe.

I can grab a photo you let me see, and pin it onto my home wall, or into a media post I'm writing.

### It's decentralised

The spaces are created on our own devices.

If you do something sitting next to me, I get the change via the WiFi, not via California.

### It's declarative

Just like programming a spreadsheet, you can build your own behaviours easily, to animate any of your stuff in the world.
