# Daily usage of LinkCraft and examples

LinkCraft is an Android app that will let us create a single, shared 3D universe.
LinkCraft gives you and your family and friends a shared space for creativity, sharing
and communicating.

Its primary unique feature is its use of **links** - between everything we create on
every device we run it.

In its early releases, the primary building material we use will be flat panels, that
can be used both for making rooms and for writing messages on.

So the first thing you may do in LinkCraft is to build a family room to share stuff. Just
quickly snap or link together some panels into a room, then put a panel on the wall as a
pinboard space to pin or link to messages and photos. Everyone can visit this room and
will see each other and can say "Hi!", and add to the pinboard.

### Building worlds together, with links between objects

Having everything in the world, from photos to cities and from leaves to forests, linked
together allows us all to quickly create a potentially huge, single, shared universe.

With links you can build a city:

 - build a house from panels linked into rooms and rooms linked together
 - add more rooms to build your virtual family home, perhaps one room for each of you
 - then build a street made of links to all the houses of your family and friends
 - add some extra houses by creating one house and dropping its link up the street
 - then build a city with links to the streets of other families

You can build shared experiences like a gallery:

 - place a large city gallery with walls linking to everyone's favourite photos in their
   albums or photo frames
 - rebuild the gallery to create many rooms organised by theme
 - a picture matching two themes in the gallery can appear twice with a link from each room
 - if you like the gallery's "landscape" room, simply grab its link and paste it onto
   your own virtual house
 - now you can wander in easily at any time (but you'll be in the gallery now, so need
   to hit the back button to return home!)

Or a warehouse:

 - create a warehouse store full of links to 3D objects to share with each other
 - fill it with plants, tables, trees, rocks, houses, castles
 - if you want to use something, you don't walk out with it, you just grab a link to it
   and drop it where you want
 - you can even grab a bit of that castle: if you like its tallest tower, simply take
   its link

You can build entire worlds:

 - create a pretty tree on a little hill
 - replicate a link from your tree to your sister's leaf, repeated all over it
 - then multiply that tree up to a forest on a mountain by dropping hill and tree links
   all over
 - if your sister changes the leaf to red in autumn, all trees that use the leaf go red
   together
 - attach that mountain to the back of your city with just a link, and another link to
   get back again
 - but have a signpost in the forest that also contains the city's link so you can save
   the walk and teleport there!
 - if you visit a fantasy village made by a different group of folk, and like it, share
   its link with the other families in the chat room
 - then if everyone in each town agrees, you can all co-create a highway through the
   hills to link the two towns up in each direction

### How does the 2D stuff work in 3D?

Panels can be used to create notes and photos. These can be shared, pinned to the walls
or even left lying around on the floor.

 - if you want to share a poster from your virtual bedroom, simply grab its link and pin
   it to the kitchen pinboard
 - now if you change anything on the poster, everyone in the kitchen can see that change too
 - drop in a link from your scrapbook of notes and photos to one of your mum's notes on
   the desk in her virtual study
 - pin a link in the middle of your virtual kitchen wall to one of your scrapbook photos
 - keep a shopping list in the virtual kitchen that everyone can see when going out

There are panels representing documents, that know about layout. You can drop panels
with text onto or into them and they will then line up with one another and you can
scroll them. You can then re-order this sequence of paragraph panels easily.

Similarly, there's a chat panel, where the stack of message panels it contains can't be
re-ordered as they are timestamped, so can only be added to at the end.

These document and chat panels are really just sequences of links to paragraph panels.
So this means that you can easily build a new document or poster by simply collecting
and dropping some links into it. These could be links to paragraph or message panels
that you find elsewhere, links to select chat messages or links to photos you like on
someone's wall. You can of course, link to bigger things in your document, like other
documents, or to complete 3D objects, or to an entire virtual city.

With document, poster and chat panels:

 - before going out, anyone can quickly make a personal shopping list by grabbing just the
   links to the items of the shared one that they plan to fetch themselves
 - create a 2D chat panel on the kitchen wall, which everyone can grab a link to to put
   in their own rooms
 - create a chat for several families
 - create a billboard with links to text paragraphs and images, describing an upcoming
   meeting or event
 - remind everyone by putting the billboard up around the city, by simply dropping its
   link down
 - if the event time changes, when you edit the billboard, all instances around update
 - create signs pointing the way to landmarks, containing a link to allow direct teleporting

Or build a city library:

 - next to the city gallery on the high street, put down a library full of links
   collecting the best documents you have created or discovered
 - maybe the holiday plans, favourite recipes or music reviews you each have in your rooms
 - or documents "published" by other families
 - collect an array of some links to snippets of text and images that you find useful for
   a short story you're writing
 - obviously, a stack, array or list of links is also an object in the world, so has its
   own link
 - if you like a paragraph in someone's document, then of course it also has a link that
   you can grab for your snippet collection
 - sit in the library and surround yourself with (links to) those snippets while you
   compose it
