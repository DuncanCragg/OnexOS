# So why not base this on the good ole' Web? That's got links already!

There are three reasons why we are better off starting again, since we basically have to
start again anyway if we use the Web:

### Fine-grained links; transclusion

The Web's links are to bundles of entire pages that give a hefty reload - you can't just
link to a paragraph! You can link to an image inside a page, but that's about it.

LinkCraft's links are to each little object in a scene, as well as to entire worlds.

### Liveness and Presence

Objects in the world (including you!) need to be live, animated. The Web doesn't do
updates natively, so it needs add-on, ad-hoc, incompatible technologies to deliver updates.

LinkCraft has a simple open protocol to both fetch objects and to send their updates
between devices.

### Peer-to-peer

The Web has servers which are tricky to set up and run, so are usually run by techies.
Your own data and identity are hidden away somewhere between these servers and the
browser.

LinkCraft gives you back control over your own data and your own identity because it's all
hosted on your own devices.

### Notes:

 - you can still use the Web's URLs to pull content into the LinkCraft universe
 - you can still use trusted online servers to give you backups and more reliable
   serving of your data, if you get serious! But these are generic services allowing you
   to easily switch providers
 - the main "cost" of not running inside the Web's browsers is needing to download
   LinkCraft, but people install apps all the time, so that's not a huge blocker
