OnexOS is an app for family Android devices that empowers non-technical families to
build and program together in a 3D virtual world.

### Program what?

Anything really, but while you're in a 3D world, you may as well:

 - build a house and have the door open for you when you stand near it
 - ... and make the light turn on inside, or get brighter the closer you are
 - add a lift that takes you up to the first floor
 - create a street of identical houses with just a simple rule or two
 - and add a car to drive up and down
 - make a game where platforms appear and disappear, and you have to keep jumping to avoid falling to the ground
 - knock up a game where objects are randomly aimed in your rough direction, and if you intercept them, you score a point; miss them and lose a point
 - make a rule to create a big spiralling chain of dominos, then run into the first one...
 - make a chill-out room with changing lights and images on the walls, with relaxing music
 - make a flower that opens in the day and closes at night
 - replicate that into a field of flowers
 - make a farm where you have soil panels and an irrigation panel down the middle; plant seeds and watch them grow when you add water
 - create a dog that follows you around, but gets distracted occasionally
 - create an ant farm where each ant has a couple of simple rules, then set off scores of ants and see how they interact

Since it's got 2D hypermedia panels in the 3D space, you can also create flat things like:

 - a message board
 - a family to-do list
 - a big-button calculator
 - a spreadsheet-style calculator for parents to quickly enter readings and track their energy usage per day
 - a family photo gallery

There's only one big space shared by everyone in the family where all of this happens in
your OnexOS, so you can re-use, re-mash and re-purpose anything, or join each family
member's buildings and games together in new ways.

OnexOS is not a fancy techie game engine like Roblox, just a way to easily knock up fun,
interactive things in a 3D virtual world on the family tablets and phones.

### How's it going?

It's early days - I just have text panels showing in Vulkan so far. Watch this space...

Meanwhile, go here for some indication of what's to come: the previous implementation of
my programming language applied to Minecraft:
