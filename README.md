# OnexOS is also building the Metaverse

Everyone is building the Metaverse these days, so one more won't hurt...

OnexOS borrows from the hubris of what TBL called the "World Wide Web" when it was still
on one or two servers, with links he called "Universal Resource Locators", when they
were still very far from universal.

OnexOS creates a Metaverse that, like the Web, is open and can be distributed around the
globe. This Metaverse is built from a single, seamless, distributed scenegraph, with
scene elements all tied together with links like Web URLs.

It's a Metaverse Web! Or a "Meta Web" - an evolution of the Web's architecture for
liveness and presence. The Web's architecture had big static documents where we were
seen as consumers. The OnexOS Metaverse has live chunks of our own 2D and 3D stuff,
where we are fully present and co-creative.

### What's the main thing?

The OnexOS Metaverse has a lot in common with the Web, but mainly it has <b>links</b>,
lots of them! The distributed scenegraph owes its seamlessness to being sewn together by
these links.

The experience in this Metaverse is of "Links between anything owned by anyone anywhere!"

Similarly to how the Web works through a Web browser and you visit, save and share
links, the OnexOS Metaverse has this app right here, where everything you do in its
Metaverse is based around links between interactive scene elements. Even your avatar has
a link!

### Why is that better?

Links are the fundamental currency of the Web - they have driven its huge expansion.
That's because links break down boundaries. Links can tie things together of disparate
types, owned by disparate people, anywhere on the planet. If you're going to boldly
build the One True Metaverse, it has to have links like the ole' Web!

### So why reinvent the Web if it's so good? Why not use all those open Web standards?

The Web runs out of steam when faced with the Metaverse challenge. I talk more about
this <a href="http://object.network/other-open-metaverses.html">here</a>.

### What kind of Metaverse are you building? Who's the target demographic?

Families mostly, at least to start off. Co-creation, sharing, exploration.

Everything we all make in the OnexOS Metaverse is in a *single*, seamless, unbounded
universe, shared by all of us.

You build everything in the OnexOS universe from simple coloured cubes and panels that
can have text or images on them.

We can link up all the spaces, creations, cities and media, documents and chats that we
create together in new ways, sharing links to materials or entire constructions,
re-using, re-mashing and re-purposing anything with anyone anywhere.

### If it's all one shared Metaverse, who owns what?

Everything you build stays owned by you, on your own device or trusted server. You get
to decide who can see or who can change your stuff: your objects can be set up to be
seen only by your family or by the public. You can set up a family photo wall, or a
message board or to-do list in a virtual family room, that are all shared just over the
family WiFi. You can share links to objects or link objects together directly between
your family's devices.  There's no account set-up, and no adverts (unless someone
creates a billboard somewhere!). You can all just jump in and start co-creating!

### How's it going?

It's early days - I just have panels with text on them rendering in Vulkan on Linux so
far! Watch this space...
