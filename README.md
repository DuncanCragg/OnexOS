# OnexOS

## What it basically is

OnexOS is an IoT or Home Automation Operating System for non-techies.


## What's different about it

It has a unique 3D touchscreen interface for non-technical people to see inside their
Things, configure them and link them together.


## Examples of how that's better (and fun)

You can walk up to a button and grab a link to it in the 3D view, then go up
to any light and drop that into it, and now the button operates the light! You can go
up to a soil moisture sensor and it zooms up in 3D, where you can see the current soil
state. Wire /that/ Thing to an RGB light and you can have a colourful display of how
dry the soil is.


## Technical deets

It currenly runs on the Raspberry Pi 4 with touchscreen and the Adafruit Feather M0
devices with mesh radio.
