# OnexOS
An app-free OS building a trap-free 3D Web

See http://object.network/

TL;DR: replaces apps and services with a shared 3D space containing us and our stuff that we can all "snap" together, hosted on our own devices.

### The app trap

Facebook and Google want your stuff, so they create traps - "app traps" - to capture it, and you.

### An OS without apps

OnexOS is a mobile OS without apps, hence no more app traps.

### OnexOSes create the Object Network

Our social network and media posts created in OnexOS now live in a space called the Object Network.

### It's decentralised

The whole Object Network is created on our own devices.

If you do something sitting next to me, I get the change via the wifi, not via California.

### The Object Network is a Metaverse, or a cyberspace

When you open your OnexOS mobile, you enter the Object Network as a 3D space containing all your stuff, and everyone else's.

### Everything just snaps together

We can "snap" together the 3D spaces we've built into super-spaces, spanning the globe.

I can grab a photo you let me see, and snap it onto my home wall, or into a media post I'm writing.
