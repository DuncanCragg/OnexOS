# OnexOS

The OnexOS Android app will be a 3D creative space where you can sketch 3D objects and
places and write and post 2D notes and documents around in virtual rooms. It's a
thinking space, a creative space or a sharing space. It will run on Android.

See this [description of the first release of the app](README-App.md).

### How's it going?

It's early days - I just have panels with text on them rendering in Vulkan on Linux so
far! Watch this space...

### Tell me more!

See <a href="http://object.network/index-meta-web.html">this article for a deep
description</a> of what I'm up to here!
