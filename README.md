# OnexOS

## What it basically is

OnexOS is an IoT or Home Automation Operating System for non-techies. It's got a bit of Augmented Reality.

Or at least that's how it will begin, but it will then branch out into being a Metaverse, programmable by non-techies!

It creates a mesh or P2P network called the Object Network.


## What's different about it

It has a tablet control panel with a unique 3D touchscreen interface, for non-technical
people to see inside their Things, configure them and link them together.

When you approach a device (a "Thing") such as a button, a sensor or a lamp, that device
appears in its 3D form on your touchscreen.

You can organise your Things into 3D rooms that match the rooms of your house.


## Examples of how that's better (and fun)

You can walk up to a button and grab a link to it (a handle on it) in the 3D view, then
go up to any lamp and drop that link into it. Now the button operates the light! You can
go up to a soil moisture sensor on a houseplant and you can see the current soil state.
Wire /that/ Thing to an RGB light and you can have a colourful display of how dry the
soil is.


## Technical deets

The goal is for OnexOS to involve the minimum of technical ability. So no soldering,
just plugging things together. And no coding, just wiring, configuring, controlling and
viewing on the tablet.

It currenly runs on the Raspberry Pi 4 with touchscreen and the Adafruit Feather M0
devices with mesh radio.
