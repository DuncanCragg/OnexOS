# OnexOS

The vision of OnexOS is of a world without apps, app-traps and "walled-garden" services;
freedom from Big Tech and empowerment over our own tech. OnexOS is a prototype
smartwatch and smartphone operating system - a proof-of-concept for how we can reclaim
control and sovereignty over our own devices and data.

It aims to achieve that with three innovations over traditional operating systems. To
start with, OnexOS has no apps, so all our data is freed and out in the open. Our data
in OnexOS can then be:

 - linked together how we like, not how an app techie decides
 - linked together peer-to-peer directly between our devices to build a single global data fabric, without techies watching or stopping us
 - animated by rules that we can write ourselves, rather than waiting for a techie to deliver it
