# OnexOS

_The following is an imaginary dialogue from the future, when I've written enough code!_

### Interesting - sounds like an operating system?

Yes, it's an OS for PCs and nRF52-based devices.

### What's different about this one?

It manifests a virtual world!

### Oh, OK. Why would you do that?

Well, because the Metaverse should be the foundation of everything computers do!

### Very bold, and abstract, but what do you see on boot-up?

You're dropped immediately into a 3D space: a "Parallel Digital Reality".

### Oh, like AR, VR - Spatial Computing?

Yes. But unlike Spatial Computing, there are no apps.

### OK, so how is all of our stuff, our data, managed?

All of our digital property is placed within this single, seamless, shared space.

### Right, but how do you do anything?

Everything can be easily snapped together how we like.

### And "snapping" together is all we need?

Mostly: here, everything just works like it would in reality.

So you have rooms with stuff pinned to the walls.

### Pinning and snapping: sounds like LEGO!

It should be that easy, yes. All achieved through the pervasive use of "links".

### Links? Like URLs?

Like enhanced URLs, yes! Links are handles onto every piece of digital property that we
own.

### Every piece?

All world objects from a flower petal up to a forest can be grabbed by their links.

### And these enhanced URLs work between my objects and yours?

Yes, exactly: this is a distributed OS; we build this space together.

### Across all of our devices?

Yes, it works Local-first and peer-to-peer.

----------------

OnexOS builds a single, seamless, global, live data fabric, owned by everyone and by
no-one.

The first target of OnexOS is to manifest a single, open, P2P Metaverse, in analogy to the Web.

The vision of OnexOS if for us all to reclaim control, sovereignty and empowerment over
our own devices, digital property and identities.
