# OnexOS
An OS _with no apps_ - returning to normal people the power and freedom promised by their own technology!

See http://object.network/

TL;DR: replaces apps and services with shared spaces containing us and our stuff that we can all "pin" together, hosted on our own devices.

### The app trap

Facebook and Google want your stuff, so they create traps - "app traps" - to capture it, and you.

### An OS without apps

OnexOS is a mobile OS without apps, hence no more app traps.

### OnexOSes create shared spaces

Our social network and media posts created in OnexOS now live in spaces that we can share.

### It's decentralised

The spaces are created on our own devices.

If you do something sitting next to me, I get the change via the wifi, not via California.

### It's a Metaverse, or a cyberspace

When you open your OnexOS mobile, you enter spaces containing all your stuff, and everyone else's.

### Everything just pins together

We can "pin" together the spaces and things we own and build into super-spaces, spanning the globe.

I can grab a photo you let me see, and pin it onto my home wall, or into a media post I'm writing.
