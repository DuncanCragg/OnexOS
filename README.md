# OnexOS

A 3D distributed OS _with no apps_, for the
[Reality Computer](https://duncancragg.substack.com/).

Replaces apps and services with a single, seamless, shared 3D universe containing us and
all our digital property, hosted on our own devices, that we can all link together.

Also see the [Object Network](http://object.network/) site.

### The app trap

Apps trap and fragment your digital stuff so nothing works together seamlessly.

### An OS without apps

OnexOS is an OS without apps, hence no more app traps.

### OnexOSes jointly manifest a single global 3D virtual universe for our stuff

Our social network and media posts created in OnexOS all land in this single, shared
universe (the "Reality Net").

When you open your device running OnexOS, you enter this universe containing all your
stuff, and everyone else's.

### Everything just links together

We can link together the spaces and things we own and build into super-spaces, spanning
the globe.

I can grab a photo you let me see, and pin it onto my home wall, or into a media post I'm
writing.

### It's decentralised

The spaces are created on our own devices.

If you do something sitting next to me, I get the change via the WiFi, not via California.

### It's declarative

Just like programming a spreadsheet, you can build your own behaviours easily, to animate
any of your stuff in the world.

----

### Only runs on Linux- and Vulkan-capable hardware

It's an OS for PCs.

It also runs on nRF52-based devices.

_The following is an imaginary dialogue from the future, when I've written enough code!_

#### What's different about this OS?

It manifests a virtual universe.

#### Ah, OK, but what do you see on boot-up?

You're dropped immediately into a 3D space, the
"[Reality Net](https://duncancragg.substack.com/)".

#### Oh, like AR, VR - Spatial Computing?

Yes. But unlike Spatial Computing, there are no apps.

#### OK, so how is all of our stuff, our data, managed?

All of our digital property is placed within this single, seamless, shared space.

#### Right, but how do you do anything?

Everything can be easily snapped together how we like.

#### And "snapping" together is all we need?

Mostly: here, everything just works like it would in reality.

So you have rooms with stuff pinned to the walls.

#### Pinning and snapping: sounds like LEGO!

It should be that easy, yes. All achieved through the pervasive use of "links".

#### Links? Like URLs?

Like _enhanced_ URLs, yes!

Links are handles onto every piece of digital property that we own.

#### Every piece?

All world objects from a paragraph or flower petal up to a library, city or forest can be
grabbed by their links.

#### And we build this space together?

These enhanced URLs work between my objects and yours; this is a distributed OS.

#### Across all of our devices?

Yes, it works Local-first and peer-to-peer.
