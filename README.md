# OnexOS

OnexOS is going to be a 3D world creator for Android, in the category of "family fun and
creative pastimes", or, to use gaming categories, a "physics sandbox 3D virtual world
simulation".

It's a way to easily knock up fun, interactive spaces and experiences in a 3D virtual
world. It will be somewhat a cross between Minecraft Creative mode, Playstation Dreams
and Second Life.

The goal is that you can quickly and easily create beautiful or imaginative places and
spaces. Make a chill-out room with coloured lights and soft-coloured walls. Then build
your ideal house, then a street of houses, then complete cities. You can create a
magical tree, then copy that into a magical wood, then multiply that wood into a magical
forest.

Things in this world have physical properties: every house you make can have doors and
windows that swing open and shut. You can make a windmill whose vanes turn when it's
windy. You can build a wheeled buggy to jump into, that can roll faster and faster down
the street from the top of the hill.  Make a game of skittles or try to build a tower
without it falling over.

Everything you make is in a single unbounded world, so you can re-use, re-mash and
re-purpose anything, and join each family member's spaces, buildings and games together
in new ways, sharing materials or entire constructions.

### How's it going?

It's early days - I just have panels showing in Vulkan on Linux so far! Watch this space...
