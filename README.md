# OnexOS

## What it basically is

OnexOS is an IoT or Home Automation Operating System for non-techies.

It creates a mesh or P2P network called the Object Network.


## What's different about it

It has a tablet control panel with a unique 3D touchscreen interface, for non-technical
people to see inside their devices and configure them.

But the most important feature is the way everything is linked together via unique IDs.


## Technical deets

The goal is for OnexOS to involve the minimum of technical ability. So no soldering,
just plugging components together. And no coding, just wiring, configuring, controlling
and viewing on the tablet.

It currenly runs on the Raspberry Pi 4 with touchscreen and the Adafruit Feather M0
devices with mesh radio.
