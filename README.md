# OnexOS

OnexOS is going to be an open Metaverse for Android aimed at regular people, like
families.

You build everything with simple coloured cuboids (cubes, panels) that can have text or
images (hypermedia) on them.

With just these basic starting materials you can build a room, a house, a street or a
city. Build a photo gallery with rooms for different subjects or time periods. Create
articles and publish them on a billboard outside your house, like a news feed. Write a
book while surrounded in 3D with source material and snippetes. Or join or create a chat
room to discuss it. Build a 3D library with all of your best recipes, or inspirational
quotes. Or why not create a huge warehouse full of 3D objects you want to share.

These can be set up to be seen by your family or by the public. You can set up a family
photo gallery, message board or to-do list.  Everything you build stays owned by you, on
your own device. You get to decide who can see it or who can change it.

Everything we all make in OnexOS is in a single unbounded world shared by all of us,
with private family spaces, so we can join all the spaces, creations, cites and media,
documents and chats that we create together in new ways, sharing materials or entire
constructions, re-using, re-mashing and re-purposing anything with anyone anywhere.

This whole virtual world is simply sewn together by links - like web links or URLs - to
each object, house, city, document, chatroom or gallery that we create.

### How's it going?

It's early days - I just have panels showing in Vulkan on Linux so far! Watch this space...
