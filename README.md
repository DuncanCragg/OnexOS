# OnexOS

OnexOS is going to be an open 3D virtual world for Android aimed at regular people, like
families.

This whole virtual world is simply sewn together by links - like web links or URLs - to
and between each object, house, city, document, chatroom or gallery that we create.

Everything we all make in OnexOS is in a single unbounded world shared by all of us,
(with private family spaces) so we can link all the spaces, creations, cities and media,
documents and chats that we create together in new ways, sharing materials or entire
constructions, re-using, re-mashing and re-purposing anything with anyone anywhere.

You build everything with simple coloured cuboids (cubes, panels) that can have text or
images (hypermedia) on them. With just these basic starting materials you can build a
room, a house, a street or a city. Build a photo gallery with rooms for different
subjects or time periods. Create articles and publish them on a billboard outside your
house, like a news feed. Write a book while surrounded in 3D with source material and
snippetes. Or join or create a chat room to discuss it. Build a 3D library with all of
your best recipes, or inspirational quotes. Or why not create a huge warehouse full of
3D objects you want to share.

Everything you build stays owned by you, on your own device. You can share links to
objects or link objects together directly between Android devices. You get to decide who
can see or who can change your stuff. Your objects can be set up to be seen by your
family or by the public. You can set up a 3D family photo gallery, or a message board or
to-do list in a virtual family room, shared just over the family WiFi.

### How's it going?

It's early days - I just have panels showing in Vulkan on Linux so far! Watch this space...
