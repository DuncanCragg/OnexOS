# OnexOS

OnexOS is going to be an open 3D virtual world for Android, aimed at regular people,
like families.

Everything we all make in OnexOS is in a single seamless, unbounded universe, shared by
all of us.

This whole universe is sewn together by *links* that we can use to tie together all of
the objects that we create.

So we can link all the items, houses, cities, galleries, spaces, creations and media,
documents, chatrooms and chats that we create together in new ways, sharing links to
anything from simple shapes up to entire constructions, cities and landscapes. We can
re-use, re-mash and re-purpose anything with anyone anywhere.

### What can you do there?

You build everything in the OnexOS universe from simple coloured cuboids (cubes, panels)
that can have text or images (hypermedia) on them. With just these basic starting
materials you can:

 - create a poster out of hypermedia - links to paragraphs and images
 - pick up a link to a paragraph in your doc and drop it into mine, or drop it into a chat message
 - grab a link to a model I've made and drop it into a chat message, now everyone can see it in 3D
 - or link from a chat message to an entire virtual city
 - stick that poster or chat message up on a wall in your virtual home by pinning up its link
 - grab links to a few key messages in a chat list and put them into a new one you created to kick off another thread of conversation based on them
 - you can build a room, a house linking to rooms, a street linking to houses and a city linking to streets
 - build a photo gallery linking several photos, with rooms linked together for different subjects or time periods
 - create articles - made of lists of links to paragraphs and images - and publish them on a billboard, like a news feed
 - pin that billboard in the garden of your virtual house
 - write a book - which has lists of links to its chapters - while surrounded in 3D with links to all the source material and snippets
 - then enter or create a 3D chat room made of links to messages and members to discuss it
 - build a 3D library with links to all of your best recipes, or inspirational quotes
 - create a huge warehouse full of links to 3D objects you want to share, like tables, plants, trees, rocks, houses
 - link our two regions, both ways, I visit and pick up something by its link from your region, go to mine and put it down
 - create a hill, then join hills into a mountain by placing its link down several times
 - place a tree on the hill, it appears on all copies of that hill
 - then put down more links to that tree on the hill to make a forest on the mountain
 - grab the link of a chat message you just read about an interesting virtual city,
   which itself contains the link to a paragraph taken from a guide describing that
   city, and also has a link to the city's entrance gateway itself - which is thus
   rendered an inch high in the message - then stick that chat message by its link into
   a pinboard that is linked onto a wall in your virtual home, so that you can visit the
   city whenever you like; if you really enjoy visiting the city, grab its link off the
   message and pin it to the bottom of your garden so it appears fully-rendered right
   there and you can simply walk through the garden gate and into the city's gateway.
 - pick up the link to the wall of a virtual gallery room that has photos displayed on
   it, and drop the link into a poster under a link to a paragraph describing the artist
   that was taken from the exhibition flyer, so the wall appears as a mini-gallery in
   the poster and people can scroll through the images, then put that poster up on the
   gallery wall on the left, so that it now appears inside itself in the mini-gallery!
 - you can visit a place invisibly until it links back to you, which it doesn't have to do
 - you can view any link in isolation, just see the thing on its own, then hit the back button to get where you were before

### Who owns this universe?

Everything you build stays owned by you, on your own device. You get to decide who
can see or who can change your stuff: your objects can be set up to be seen only by your
family or by the public. You can set up a 3D family photo gallery, or a message board or
to-do list in a virtual family room, shared just over the family WiFi. You can share
links to objects or link objects together directly between your family's Android
devices.  There's no account set-up, and no adverts (unless someone creates a billboard
somewhere!). You just jump in and start co-creating!

### How's it going?

It's early days - I just have panels with text on them rendering in Vulkan on Linux so
far! Watch this space...
