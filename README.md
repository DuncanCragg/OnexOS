# OnexOS

The OnexOS Android app gives you and your family a 3D creative space where you can
all sketch 3D objects and places and write and post 2D notes and documents around in
virtual rooms.

Use it as a thinking space, a creative space or a sharing space; have fun exploring each
others creations.

You can run it on a shared family Android tablet, or on the LineageOS version of Android
on a Raspberry Pi 4 behind your family TV! Each family member can have their own stuff.

### What can you do?

This space owes its creative "mashability" to being sewn, tied or snapped together
everywhere by "links" - links between your leaves on my tree, or between my forest and
your city.

You build everything in OnexOS from simple coloured panels that can have text or images
on them. These are then linked together into the creative space that you play in. With
just these basic starting materials you can:

Build a house from panels linked into rooms and rooms linked together. Then build a
street made of links to all the houses of your family and friends. Then build a city
with links to the streets of other families. Leave messages around linked to the walls
of the family virtual home kitchen. Then collect those onto a pinboard by grabbing and
pasting their links. Start up a 2D chatroom between families which has links to lists of
messages and people. But then meet in a 3D room to chat as well; a room links to the
people present. Create a billboard with links to text paragraphs and images, describing
an upcoming meeting or event. Put the billboard up around the city by simply dropping
its link down. Create signs pointing the way to landmarks, containing a link to allow
direct teleporting. Put down a library on the high street full of links to documents you
have each created, like favourite recipes or music reviews. Next to that, a large city
gallery with many rooms with walls linking to everyone's favourite photos. Create a
warehouse store full of links to 3D objects to share with others, like plants, tables,
trees, rocks, houses, castles. You can create a pretty tree on a little hill, then
multiply that up to a forest on a mountain by dropping hill and tree links all over.
Attach that mountain to the back of your city with just a single link. If you visit
another city made by a different group of folk, and like it, share its link with the
other families in the chat room. Then if everyone in each city agrees, you can all
co-create a highway through the hills to link the two cities up in each direction.

### How's it going?

It's early days - I just have panels with text on them rendering in Vulkan on Linux so
far! Watch this space...
