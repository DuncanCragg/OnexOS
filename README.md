# OnexOS

OnexOS has no apps. Instead it delivers the Power of the Link! Links enable all our data
to be freed and brought under our control; to be:

 - re-structured how we like
 - re-decentralised peer-to-peer directly between our devices
 - re-animated by rules that we can write ourselves

OnexOS is a prototype smartphone and smartwatch operating system - a proof-of-concept
for how we can reclaim control, sovereignty and empowerment over our own devices and our
own data. The vision of OnexOS is of a world without apps, app-traps and "walled-garden"
services; freedom from Big Tech and Inscrutable Tech. Building a single global data
fabric owned by everyone and by no-one.
