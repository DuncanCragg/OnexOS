# OnexOS is also building the Metaverse

No-one is building The One Open Metaverse these days, so I thought I'd do it...

The OnexOS Metaverse is built from a single distributed scenegraph, with scene elements
all tied together with links like Web URLs. The distributed scenegraph owes its
seamlessness - between your leaves on my tree, or between a my forest and your city - to
being sewn together by these links.

You build everything in the OnexOS universe from simple coloured cubes and panels that
can have text or images on them (although the building materials will expand over time).

These are then linked together into the universe that we're going to build together.

### How's it going?

It's early days - I just have panels with text on them rendering in Vulkan on Linux so
far! Watch this space...

description of what I'm up to here</a>!

OnexOS is part of an even *more* insanely ambitious project, which is described
