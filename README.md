# OnexOS

OnexOS has no apps, so all our data is freed and under our control. Having no apps leads
us to discover the Power of the Link! Links enables our data to be:

 - re-structured how we like
 - re-decentralised peer-to-peer directly between our devices
 - re-animated by rules that we can write ourselves

OnexOS is a prototype smartphone and smartwatch operating system - a proof-of-concept
for how we can reclaim control, sovereignty and empowerment over our own devices and our
own data. The vision of OnexOS is of a world without apps, app-traps and "walled-garden"
services; freedom from Big Tech and Inscrutable Tech. Building a single global data
fabric owned by everyone and by no-one.
