# OnexOS

OnexOS has an Android app (called LinkCraft) that represents an approach to building an
open virtual world.

See this description of the first release of the [LinkCraft app](README-App.md).

Perhaps it can become the "One Open Metaverse". Without the Web. Without Blockchains.

Maybe even without VR (hopefully AR will mature before VR support is demanded!).

### How's it going?

It's early days - I just have panels with text on them rendering in Vulkan on Linux so
far! Watch this space...

### Tell me more!

See <a href="http://object.network/index-meta-web.html">this article for a deep
description</a> of what I'm up to here!
