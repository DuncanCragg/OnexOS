# OnexOS

_The following is an imaginary dialogue from the future, when I've written enough code!_

### Interesting - sounds like an operating system?

Yes, it's an OS for Raspberry Pi 4s and nRF52-based devices.

### What's different about this one?

It has no apps or applications!

### Oh, OK. Why would you do that?

Well, without apps, there can be no "app trap"!

### What's the "app trap"?

Apps (and their backing services) prevent our digital property working together.

### Give me an example of our "digital property working together" in your OS.

OK: I could pin the reading from my thermostat into your slide deck, with your
permission, and it will continue to be "live" there.

### Ah yes, I can see that my home automation and slides apps won't allow that!

Unless both happened to be built by a Big Tech corporation, and all this was running
within their silo servers.

### Cool. So, without apps, what do you see on boot-up?

You're dropped immediately into a shared 3D space.

### Wow. Why 3D?

It's a "Parallel Digital Reality".

### Oh, like AR, VR - Spatial Computing?

Yes. Now that we're free from apps, all of our digital property can be easily snapped
together within a single, seamless, shared space.

### So you build in 3D?

Yes. Here, everything just works like reality. So you have rooms with calendars and
notes pinned to the walls.

### Pinning and snapping: sounds like LEGO!

It should be that easy, yes. All that is achieved through the pervasive use of "links".

### Links? Like URLs?

Like enhanced URLs, yes! Links are handles onto every piece of digital property that we
own: all world objects from a single paragraph or flower petal up to libraries and
forests can be grabbed by their links.

OnexOS builds a single, seamless, global, live data fabric, owned by everyone and by
no-one.

With OnexOS, we can reclaim control, sovereignty and empowerment over our own devices,
digital property and identities.
