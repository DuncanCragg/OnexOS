Building


In OnexKernel:

> make bootloader -j


Here:

> make clean
> make pinetime-erase
> make pinetime-flash-bootloader -j
> make pinetime-flash-sd
> make pinetime-flash

This wipes the watch, builds the watch code and settings for flashing the bootloader
from OnexKernel, flashes the SD and finally the watch code itself.


Building a zip for OTA:

> make pinetime-ota -j
> scp -P 2222 onx-wear.zip myop65:SDCard

This creates a zip for flashing on the phone

Then, in the DFU app, choose this zip, select the "Onex Update" Bluetooth device, and
flash it. The watch screen has a little animated square to keep you hypnotised into
thinking you're doing the right thing.
